# Codetree Algorithm Solutions - qoocrab

This repository contains **my personal solutions** to algorithm problems from [Codetree](https://www.codetree.ai/), a site dedicated to improving coding skills through structured problem sets.

## 📋 What's Inside

Codetree organizes problems into "Trails"—a series of stages that guide you from basic logic to more advanced algorithms. This repository includes my solutions from **Trail 0 to Trail 6**, each one getting a little tougher (and occasionally more annoying) than the last.

## 🛠️ Features

* Python solutions organized by trail and problem title
* **Time complexity** noted in comments for most problems
* Clean, readable code
* Focused on correctness, clarity, and personal learning

## 📚 Resources

* [Codetree](https://www.codetree.ai/)
* [Python Docs](https://docs.python.org/3/)
